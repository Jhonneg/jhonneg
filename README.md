# Web Design is my passion
Hello, my name is Jhonne, currently i'm learning web development by myself, in the moment i'm learning the basics(HTML, CSS, Javascript and React) but in the future i plan to focus on Java script graphics libraries, like Three.js.
I have a genuine interest graphics designing in web browsers, from 2D basic animations to 3D interactive complex interfaces.
