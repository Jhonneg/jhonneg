# About me

Hello, my name is Jhonne and front end development is my main focus.

Being able to create true works of visual art with lines of code is something that fascinated me about web development.

Plus the possibility of putting in practice problem solving skills, searching for pratical solutions and having a creative outlet allows me to grow as a developer.

Since you can marry all these things together with web development, plus build a career on top of that, i've found what i'm passionate about.
