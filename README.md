# "An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity."
Hello, my name is Jhonne and web development is my passion, currently i'm learning web development by myself, in the moment i'm learning the basics(HTML, CSS, Javascript and React) but in the future i plan to focus on Java script graphics libraries, like Three.js.
I have a genuine interest graphics design in web browsers, from 2D basic animations to 3D interactive interfaces. 
Since i can get both together in web development with Javascript, i've found what i'm passionate about.
